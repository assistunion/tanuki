= Tanuki

Tanuki is a web application framework inspired by the MVVM pattern with focus
on DRY code and extensibility. Tanuki tries to keep its looks close to
idiomatic Ruby, so you would feel at home.

Right now it's very raw, so don't expect things to work properly.

== Quick Start

Fire up the terminal and type:

  $ gem install tanuki
  $ tanuki
  tanuki> create test
  tanuki> server

View the result at: http://localhost:3000
